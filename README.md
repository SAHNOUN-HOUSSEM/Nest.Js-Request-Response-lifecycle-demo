# NestJS Learning Request/Response Lifecycle

This repository contains a NestJS application created for the purpose of learning about middleware, guards, interceptors, pipes, and exception filters.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone [text](https://github.com/SAHNOUN-HOUSSEM/Nest.Js-Request-Response-lifecycle-demo.git)

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Nest.Js-Request-Response-lifecycle-demo

3. Install dependencies:
   npm install

## Usage

To run the NestJS application locally, use the following command:
npm run start:dev

Once the server is running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a typical NestJS folder structure:

- `src/`: Contains all source code files
  - `controllers/`: Controllers responsible for handling incoming requests
  - `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions
  - `guards/`: Custom guards for authorization/authentication
  - `interceptors/`: Interceptors for modifying the request/response objects
  - `pipes/`: Pipes for data transformation and validation
  - `exceptions/`: Custom exception filters
  - `modules/`: NestJS modules for organizing code
  - `services/`: Services for business logic and data access

## Middleware, Guards, Interceptors, Pipes, and Exception Filters

In this project, I've implemented various middleware, guards, interceptors, pipes, and exception filters to handle different aspects of the request/response lifecycle. Each of these components plays a crucial role in enhancing the functionality and security of the NestJS application.
